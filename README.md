We segment customers into 5 categories :

1 Platinum 

2  Gold

3  Silver

4 Bronze

5 Copper

Their values are in order of Platinum > Premium Gold > Standard Gold > Silver > Bronze > Lost Customers

We used the Microsoft PowerBI tool to generate this model. We include Great Britain data while preparing for model
